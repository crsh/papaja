# papaja (upcoming)

### Template

- Fixed bugs that occurred when using unicode characters in an appendix file (reported by @mschrein, #446 and @kalenkovich, #353).


### Existing functions

- `apa_print()`
    - Output now always contains a `$table` element (as suggested in #324 by @Kalif-Vaughn)
    - Column names of `$table` element are now standardized following the `broom` glossary (e.g., `term`, `estimate`, `conf.int`, `statistic`, `df`, `df.residual`, `p.value`, see https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/#glossary).
        - To maintain backwards compatibility, it is possible to access columns with aliases (for instance, it is possible to write `output$table$F` and obtain `output$table$statistic`, see #364).
        - Table columns are labelled (e.g., `"\\hat{\\eta}^2_G"`, `"$F$", "$p$`, ...) for creating tables via `apa_table()`.
    - Added a new argument `estimate` to ANOVA-methods, which accepts a character string (`"ges"`, `"pes"`, and `"es"`; primarily for backward compatibility), a data frame (with columns `estimate`, `conf.low`, and `conf.high`), or a function to determine which measure of effect size is to be reported. If a function is supplied, it should take the ANOVA-object as input and return a data frame with columns `estimate`, `conf.low`, and `conf.high`. Currently, output from the [`{effectsize}`](https://CRAN.r-project.org/package=effectsize) package is supported. By default, if `{effectsize}` is installed, generalized eta-squared (point estimate and confidence interval) will be calculated. Otherwise, only the point estimate will be calculated as before.
    - Argument `es` is now deprecated, but because it is a partial match with `estimate`, old code using `es = "ges"`, `es = "pes"` or `es = "es"` will still work and yield the same results.
    - `apa_print.list()`: Added progress bars for bootstrapped model comparisons.
    - `apa_print.emmGrid()` and friends
        - Extended support for additional link functions and output, e.g. (`emmeans::joint_tests()`, #200, PR #476)
        - Adjusted p-values, confidence intervals, and families of tests are now marked as such (see `?apa_print.emmGrid`; #200, PR #476)
        - Fixed wrong estimate labels for interaction contrasts (reported by @shirdekel, #456).
    - `variable_label()`, `variable_labels()`, and  `label_variables()` now reside in CRAN package [`{tinylabels}`](https://CRAN.r-project.org/package=tinylabels), which is automatically loaded when `{papaja}` is loaded.


# papaja 0.1.0.9997

### Template

- New author metadata field `role` automatically adds contributor ship roles (e.g. CRedit, https://casrai.org/credit/) to the author note. #375
- `apa6_pdf()`
    - Now relies on a Lua-filter to process metadata, which should resolve many encoding related problems (e.g., reported by @arcaldwell49, @dcbrh, and @DominiqueMakowski among others; #350, #357, #360)

    - Fixed method dispatch that sometimes failed (#361, #250)
- `apa_print.list()`

    - Now always returns a `character`
- `printp()`
    - Fixed examples in documentation
- `variable_labels.data.frame()`
    - When trying to assign labels to columns that do not exist, as of now the function
      not only throws an error, but also returns the names of the missing columns.
- `wsci()`, `within_subjects_conf_int()`
    - Experimental: Returned object now has class `c("papaja_wsci", "data.frame")` and returns an
      attribute `means` for post processing (see new function `summary.papaja_wsci`).

### New functions

- `apa_print.manova()`
    - Experimental: Added an `apa_print` method for MANOVA models from the `stats` package.
- `summary.papaja_wsci()`
    - Experimental: Returns means and confidence limits calculated from the output
      of `wsci()` (suggested by @jstevens5, #362)
