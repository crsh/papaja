  abstract = {In their paper Why optional stopping is a problem for Bayesians, @deHeide:Grunwald:2020 critique the claim that those using Bayes factor can sample until there is sufficient evidence to support one or another model.  de Heide and Grünwald's main message is that unless you believe your priors to govern the data-generating mechanism, optional stopping may distort inference.  We show here that the distortions are not in inference but in interpretation. Their claim is about what happens when the analyst's models do not match the data generating models, that is, the Bayes factor for models not specified. Given that we never know the underlying data generation mechanism we ask researcher to interpret Bayes factors for what they are---the relative strength of evidence from data for two hypotheticals.   We discuss how researchers should assess the robustness of their results by considering reasonable variation in model specification conditional on observed data rather than on hypothetical truths.},

  url = {https://osf.io/3xsbu},
  doi = {10.31234/osf.io/3xsbu},
  abstract = {Whether attitudes can be acquired unconsciously is a question of both theoretical and practical interest. One paradigm supporting the possibility of unconscious attitude learning is the surveillance paradigm (Olson \&amp; Fazio, 2001), which relies on incidental learning conditions. In a recent pre-registered replication report, Moran (2020) claimed that they obtained evidence for attitude learning in this paradigm that was not moderated by the level of awareness of the participants. Here, we explain that this claim is unwarranted and report meta-analytic results supporting our conclusion. Specifically, we distinguish between independent sets of fully aware, partially aware, and fully aware participants. We show that evaluative learning effects are moderated by participants’ set and are found in the latter two sets only. We discuss this finding in the broader perspective of associative attitude learning models.  Manuscript and code are available at https://osf.io/qs35v.},

  abstract = {The N400 waveform carries new insight into the nature of linguistic processing and may shed light into the automaticity of priming word relationships. We investigated semantic and associative word pairs in classic lexical decision and letter search tasks to examine their differences in cognitive processing. Normed database information was used to create orthogonal semantic and associative word relationships to clearly define N400 waveforms and priming for these pairs. Participants showed N400 reduction for related word pairs, both semantic and associative, in comparison to unrelated word pairs for the lexical decision task, indicating automatic access for both types of relatedness. For a letter search task, the N400 showed differences between nonwords and other stimuli but no attenuation for related pairs. Response latency data indicated associative priming in both tasks with semantic priming also found in the letter search task. These results help discern possible automatic and controlled processes occurring during these tasks, as the N400 may show automatic processing during the lexical decision task, while the response latency data may provide evidence for controlled processing during the letter search task.},

  abstract = {Video lectures are increasingly prevalent, but they present challenges to learners. Students' minds often wander, yet we know little about how mind wandering affects attention during video lectures. This paper presents two studies that examined eye movement patterns of mind wandering during video lectures. In the studies, mind wandering reports were collected by either self-caught reports or thought probes. Results were similar across the studies: mind wandering was associated with an increased allocation of fixations to the instructor's image. For fixations on the slides, the average duration increased but the dispersion decreased. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggested that fixation duration and dispersion can diminish soon after self-caught reports of mind wandering. Overall, these findings help advance our understanding of how learners' attention is affected during mind wandering and may facilitate efforts in objectively identifying mind wandering. Future research is needed to determine if these findings can extend to other instructional formats.},

  abstract = {People have been argued to mentally represent the implied orientation of objects (Stanfield \& Zwaan, 2001). However, the effect is rather small in a sentence-picture verification task compared to published effects of other visual dimensions, such as shape, size, and color. The present study examines whether object size moderates the orientation effect. Theoretical considerations of how we interact with manipulable versus non-manipulable objects lead us to predict a smaller effect for manipulable objects than for non-manipulable objects. We furthermore predict the generalization of this pattern across languages (Chinese, Dutch, and English). Furthermore, we seek converging evidence in a picture-picture verification task that compares the verification times between pairs of rotated or non-rotated objects.  Longer verification times for large objects would indicate that these objects require more cognitive effort for mental simulation than small objects, regardless of the presence of language.},
