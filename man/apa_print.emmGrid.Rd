\title{Typeset Statistical Results from Estimated Marginal Means}
\usage{
\method{apa_print}{emmGrid}(x, infer = TRUE, conf.int = 0.95, ...)

\method{apa_print}{summary_emm}(
  x,
  contrast_names = NULL,
  est_name = "\\\\hat{\\\\theta}",
  in_paren = FALSE,
  ...
)

\method{apa_print}{lsmobj}(x, ...)

\method{apa_print}{summary.ref.grid}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object}

\item{infer}{A vector of one or two logical values. The first determines
whether confidence intervals are displayed, and the second determines
whether \emph{t} tests and \emph{P} values are displayed. If only one value
is provided, it is used for both.}

\item{conf.int}{Numeric. Confidence level for confidence intervals.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=printnum]{printnum}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{}}{}
  }}

\item{contrast_names}{Character. An optional vector of names to label the
calculated contrasts.}

\item{est_name}{Character. If \code{NULL} (default) the name of the estimate
is inferred from the function call of the model object supplied to
\pkg{emmeans}.}

\item{in_paren}{Logical. Whether the formatted string is to be reported in
parentheses. If \code{TRUE}, parentheses in the formatted string (e.g., those
enclosing degrees of freedom) are replaced with brackets.}
}
\description{
Takes various \pkg{emmeans} objects to create formatted character strings to
report the results in accordance with APA manuscript guidelines.
\emph{\pkg{emmeans} supports a wide range of analyses, not all
of which are currently (fully) supported. Proceed with caution.}
}
\details{
When p-values and confidence intervals are adjusted for multiple testing,
the correction method is added as an index to the output (e.g.
\verb{p_\{Tukey(3)\}}). Values in parenthesis indicate the size of the family of
tests or the rank of the set of linear functions (for the Scheffé method).

If possible, each family of tests is additionally marked in the returned
table by alphabetic superscripts.

Generally, the \code{summary_emm} objects returned by \code{emmeans::summary_emm} omit
information that may be needed to add some of the information on the
adjustments made to p-values and confidence intervals. It is therefore
preferable to pass \code{emmGrid}-objects if possible. For example, by using
\code{emmeans(object, 1 ~ x1, adjust = "scheffe")}.
}
\examples{
  # From the emmeans manual:
  library(emmeans)
  warp.lm <- lm(breaks ~ wool*tension, data = warpbreaks)
  warp.emm <- emmeans(warp.lm, ~ tension | wool)
  warp.contr <- contrast(warp.emm, "poly")

  apa_print(warp.contr)

  # In this example, because degrees of freedom are equal across all rows
  # of the output, it is possible to move that information to the variable
  # labels. This is useful if a compact results table is required:

  df_to_label(apa_print(warp.contr))

\concept{apa_print}
\value{
\code{apa_print()}-methods return a named list of class \code{apa_results} containing the following elements:

\item{estimate}{One or more character strings giving point estimates, confidence intervals, and confidence level. A single string is returned in a vector; multiple strings are returned as a named list. If no estimate is available the element is \code{NULL}.}
\item{statistic}{One or more character strings giving the test statistic, parameters (e.g., degrees of freedom), and p-value. A single string is returned in a vector; multiple strings are returned as a named list. If no estimate is available the element is \code{NULL}.}
\item{full_result}{One or more character strings comprised `estimate` and `statistic`. A single string is returned in a vector; multiple strings are returned as a named list. }
\item{table}{A \code{data.frame} of class \code{apa_results_table} that contains all elements of \code{estimate} and \code{statistics}. This table can be passed to \code{apa_table()} for reporting.}

Column names in \code{apa_results_table} are standardized following the \href{https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/#glossary}{\pkg{broom} glossary} (e.g., \code{term}, \code{estimate} \code{conf.int}, \code{statistic}, \code{df}, \code{df.residual}, \code{p.value}). Additionally, each column is labelled (e.g., \code{$\\hat{\\eta}^2_G$} or \code{$t$}) using the \pkg{tinylabels} package and these labels are used as column names when an \code{apa_results_table} is passed to \code{apa_table()}.
