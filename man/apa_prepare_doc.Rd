\title{Prepare APA document (deprecated)}
\usage{
apa_prepare_doc()
}
\value{
Returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
Prepares objects to be used in the rendering process and creates title page
and abstract for MS Word documents. \emph{This function has been defunct. It is
no longer needed.}
}
\details{
The function creates and locks a non-exported object \code{apa_lang}
that is used by other \pkg{papaja}-functions. \code{apa_lang} is a
\code{list} containing localizations for document elements such as abstract
and title. The selected language is defined by the \code{lang}-parameter
in the documents yaml-header. Currently, English (default) and German
(\code{"german"}) are supported.

If the output document is MS Word (\verb{output: \link{apa6_word}}) the
function additionally creates a title page and adds the abstract. You
should, therefore, always call \code{apa_prepare_doc} at the very
beginning of the R Markdown document.
