**papaja** is an [award-winning](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/) R package that facilitates creating computationally reproducible, submission-ready manuscripts which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition).
**papaja** provides

-   an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template that can be used with (or without) [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to create PDF documents (using the [apa6](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/apa6) LaTeX class) or Word documents (using a .docx-reference file).
-   Functions to **typeset** the results from **statistical analyses**,
-   functions to create **tables**, and
-   functions to create **figures** in accordance with APA guidelines.

For a comprehensive introduction to **papaja**, see the current draft of the [manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/).
If you have a specific question that is not answered in the manual, feel free to ask a question on Stack Overflow [using the **papaja** tag](https://t.co/Z3auyUrbTa).
If you believe you have found a bug or would like to request a new feature, [open an issue](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) on Github and provide a [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

## Example

Take a look at the [R Markdown file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).
The example document also contains some basic instructions.

## Installation

To use **papaja** you need either a recent version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) or [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
If you want to create PDF- in addition to DOCX-documents you additionally need a [TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution.
We recommend you use [TinyTex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), which can be installed from within R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!"tinytex" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You may also consider [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux.
Please refer to the [**papaja** manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started) for detailed installation instructions.

**papaja** is not yet available on CRAN but you can install it from this repository:

```{r install_papapja, eval = FALSE}
# Install remotes package if necessary
if(!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("remotes")

# Install the stable development version from GitHub
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja")

# Install the latest development snapshot from GitHub
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja@devel")
```

## Usage

Once **papaja** is installed, you can select the APA template when creating a new R Markdown file through the RStudio menus.

![APA template selection dialog](inst/images/template_selection.png)

To add citations, specify your bibliography-file in the YAML front matter of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and start citing (for details, see pandoc manual on the [citeproc extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations). You may also be interested in [**citr**](https://github.com/crsh/citr), an R Studio addin to swiftly insert Markdown citations and [R Studio's visual editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/), which also enables swiftly [inserting citations](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html).

### Typeset analysis results

The functions `apa_print()` and `apa_table()` facilitate reporting results of your analyses.
When you pass the an output object of a supported class, such as an `htest`- or `lm`-object, to `apa_print()`, it will return a list of character strings that you can use to report the results of your analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library("papaja")
```

```{r}
my_lm <- lm(
  Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length
  , data = iris
)
apa_lm <- apa_print(my_lm)

apa_lm$full_result$Sepal_Length
```

**papaja** currently provides methods for the following object classes:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print_classes <- gsub("apa_print\\.", "", as.character(utils::methods("apa_print")))
print_classes <- print_classes[!grepl(",", print_classes)]
print_classes <- c(print_classes, rep(NA,  (4 - length(print_classes) %% 4) * (length(print_classes) %% 4 > 0)))
print_classes <- matrix(print_classes, ncol = 4)
colnames(print_classes) <- apply(print_classes, 2, function(x) {
  first_letters <- tolower(substr(x, 1, 1))
  first_letters <- c(first_letters[1], tail(first_letters, 1))
  first_letters[is.na(first_letters)] <- "z"
  col_names <- if(first_letters[1] == first_letters[2]) first_letters[1] else paste(first_letters, collapse = "-")
  toupper(col_names)
})
print_classes[is.na(print_classes)] <- ""
print_classes[grepl("glht|BayesFactor", print_classes)] <- paste0(print_classes[grepl("glht|BayesFactor", print_classes)], "<sup>*</sup>")

knitr::kable(print_classes)
```

\* Not fully tested, don't trust blindly!

### Create tables

`apa_table()` may be used to produce publication-ready tables in an R Markdown document.
For instance, you might want to report some condition means (with standard errors).

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
npk |>
  group_by(N, P) |>
  summarise(mean = mean(yield), se = se(yield), .groups = "drop") |>
  label_variables(N = "Nitrogen", P = "Phosphate", mean = "*M*", se = "*SE*") |>
  apa_table(caption = "Mean pea yield (with standard errors)")
```

Table 1.
*Mean pea yield (with standard errors)*

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
out <- npk %>%
  group_by(N, P) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(yield), se = se(yield), .groups = "drop")
colnames(out) <- c("Nitrogen", "Phosphate", "*M*", "*SE*")
knitr::kable(out, align = "c", digits = 2)
```

This is a fairly simple example, but `apa_table()` may be used to generate [more complex tables](https://osf.io/s4968/).

`apa_table()`, of course, plays nicely with the output from `apa_print()`.
Thus, it is possible to conveniently report complete regression tables, ANOVA tables, or the output from mixed-effects models.

```{r eval = FALSE}
lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris) |>
  apa_print() |>
  apa_table(caption = "Iris regression table.")
```

Table 2.
*Iris regression table.*

```{r echo = FALSE}
out <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris) |>
  apa_print()
colnames(out$table) <- variable_labels(out$table)
knitr::kable(out$table, align = "lrcrr")
```

### Create figures

**papaja** further provides functions to create publication-ready plots.
For example, you can use `apa_barplot()`, `apa_lineplot()`, and `apa_beeplot()` (or the general function `apa_factorial_plot()`) to visualize the results of factorial study designs:

```{r include = FALSE}
set.seed(42L)
x <- expand.grid(
  id = seq_len(80L)
  , congruency = c("Congruent", "Incongruent")
  , load       = c("High", "Low")
)

x[["response_time"]] <- rt(nrow(x), df = 20) * 80 + 
  (x$congruency == "Congruent") * - 80 + 
  (x$load == "High") * 40 + 
  500


variable_labels(x) <- list(
  congruency = "Congruency"
  , load = "Cognitive load"
  , response_time = "Response time"
)
stroop_data <- x
```

```{r stroop-plot, fig.cap = "Response times from a simulated Stroop experiment. Large dots represent condition means, small dots represent individual participants' mean response time. Error bars represent 99% within-subjects confidence intervals."}
apa_beeplot(
  data = stroop_data
  , dv = "response_time"
  , id = "id"
  , factors = c("congruency", "load")
  , ylim = c(0, 800)
  , dispersion = wsci # within-subjects confidence intervals
  , conf.level = .99
  , las = 1
)
```

If you prefer creating your plots with `ggplot2`, try `theme_apa()`.

```{r stroop-ggplot}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggforce")

p <- ggplot(
  stroop_data
  , aes(x = congruency, y = response_time, shape = load, fill = load)
) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.2, color = grey(0.6)) +
  geom_sina(color = grey(0.6)) +
  stat_summary(position = position_dodge2(0.95), fun.data = mean_cl_normal) +
  lims(y = c(0, max(stroop_data$response_time))) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 22)) +
  scale_fill_grey(start = 0.6, end = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Congruency"
    , y = "Response time"
    , shape = "Cognitive load"
    , fill = "Cognitive load"
  )

p + theme_apa()
```

### Usage without RStudio

Don't use RStudio?
No problem.
Use the `rmarkdown::render` function to create articles:

``` r
# Create new R Markdown file
rmarkdown::draft(
  "mymanuscript.Rmd"
  , "apa6"
  , package = "papaja"
  , create_dir = FALSE
  , edit = FALSE
)

# Render manuscript
rmarkdown::render("mymanuscript.Rmd")
```

## Computational reproducibility

To ensure mid- to long-term computational reproducibility we highly recommend conserving the software environment used to write a manuscript (e.g. R and all R packages) either in a software container or a virtual machine.
This way you can be sure that your R code does not break because of updates to R or any R package.
For a brief primer on containers and virtual machines see [the supplementary material](https://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de/analytic-reproducibility.html#document-hardware-and-software-used-for-analyses) by Klein et al. (2018).

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most widely used containerization approach.
It is open source and free to use but requires some disk space.
[CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) is a commercial service that builds on Docker, facilitates setting up and sharing containers and lets you run computations in the cloud.
See the **papaja** manual on [how to get started using **papaja** with Docker or CodeOcean](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/tips-and-tricks.html#reproducible-software-environments).
